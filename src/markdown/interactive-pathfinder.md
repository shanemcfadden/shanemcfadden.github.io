title: "Interactive Pathfinder"

A single page application that allows users to select start and end points from a grid and calculate the easiest path between them. They may also draw textures to make it easier or harder to reach the end. This pathfinder implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find a path with the lowest difficulty.
